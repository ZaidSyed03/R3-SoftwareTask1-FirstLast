Training Task 1 | Software

As explained in the video (Found below) I have my project set up to display numbers from 1-9 and dispaly some letters from the alphabet.
The potentiometer although only directly connected to ground and a single pin adds resistance to 2 segments of the 7 segment led becuase of the way i have wired it. Technically it should be to the entire led unit but becuase of resistance it is only affecting those 2 at random.
Unfortunately, I was not able to perfect the project or display all my skills becuase mid terms have been killing me and I have a legal issue that I have been dealing with along with university.
I used a physical raspberry which was not avaible in tinker cad so instead I made a video and pictures to explain my project.

I used a raspebrry Pi which was not availoble on tinker cad so I made a random diagram in tinkercad just to show that I am familiar with the software

I wish I could have spent more time to really show the team how I will be an asset. 
As brief intriduction I would like to mention that I was the leader of the robotics team in my middle school and competed in PSC. I have wokred with verious types of electrical componenets for as long as I can rememebr and have wokred with the electrical and software (where applicable) of phones, computers, cars and houses. Needless to say I have a unique set of skills that will gretaly benefit the team.
