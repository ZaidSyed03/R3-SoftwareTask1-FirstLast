Training Task 1 | Software

As explained in the video I have my project set up to display numbers from 1-9 an ddispaly some letters from the alphabet.
The potentiometer although only directly connected to ground and a single pin adds resistance to 2 segments of the 7 segment led becuase of the way i have wired it. technically it shoul dbe to the entire led unit but becuase of ristance it is only affecting those 2 at random.
Unfortunately, I was not able to perfect the project or display all my skills becuase mid terms have been killing me and I have a legal issue that I have been dealing with along with university.

I wish I coul dhave spent more time to really show the team how I will be an asset. 
As brief intriduction I would like to mention that I was the leader of the robotics team in my middle school and competed in PSC. I have wokred with verious types of electrical componenets for as long as I can rememebr and have wokred with the electrical and software (where applicable) of phones, computers, cars and houses. Needless to say I have a unique set of skills that will gretaly benefit the team.
